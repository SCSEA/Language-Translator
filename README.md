# Language-Translator
Language-Translator or language translation program is a software application or service that translates text or speech from one language to another.

Translators can also interpret programming code, converting it to instructions that a computer can understand and execute. For example, a compiler is an example of a translator that takes a programming language (e.g., C++) and translates into machine language or assembly language the computer can understand.
